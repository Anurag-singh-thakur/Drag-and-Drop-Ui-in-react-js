# Drag-and-Drop UI with Resizable Cards in React

This project is a React-based application built with Vite that allows users to create, drag, and resize cards on a scrollable canvas. Each card can display a snippet of text with an option to show more in a popup. The canvas supports the connection of cards using arrows.

## Features

- **Add Cards**: Users can add cards to the canvas, each containing some dummy text.
- **Drag and Drop**: Cards can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the canvas.
- **Resizable Cards**: Cards can be resized using a resizable box feature.
- **Scrollable Canvas**: The canvas is scrollable, allowing users to navigate through the entire workspace.
- **Show More**: Cards only show a snippet of text by default, with a "Show More" button to display the full text.
- **Popup Details**: Clicking on "Show More" opens a detailed view of the card's content in a popup.
